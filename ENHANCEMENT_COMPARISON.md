File Size: 13 KB (highly optimized)
Improvements:
- 2.5x DPI increase (120 → 300)
- Local adaptive thresholding for text clarity
- Sigmoidal contrast for non-linear enhancement
- Highly compressed for easy sharing
- Best text/background separation
```

### Enhanced Version 3 (Super-Resolution)
```
File: Page 1 Catherine's Diary Super-Resolution.jpg
Resolution: 1178x1534 pixels (600 DPI)
Colorspace: Grayscale
Dynamic Range: 0-255 (full range)
File Size: 676 KB
Improvements:
- 5x DPI increase (120 → 600)
- 4x pixel count increase (2x in each dimension)
- Advanced interpolation for resolution scaling
- Extreme sharpening for text edges
- Suitable for high-resolution displays and printing
```

## Enhancement Techniques Applied

1. **Colorspace Conversion**: RGB → Grayscale
   - Eliminates color noise
   - Focuses on luminance for text clarity

2. **Denoising**:
   - Despeckle filter removes random noise
   - Gaussian morphology smooths without losing detail

3. **Contrast Enhancement**:
   - Normalization expands to full 0-255 range
   - Contrast stretching removes extreme outliers
   - Sigmoidal contrast for perceptually better results
   - Auto-leveling for optimal tonal distribution

4. **Sharpening**:
   - Adaptive sharpening adjusts to local features
   - Unsharp masking enhances text edges
   - Multi-pass approach for crisp results

5. **Resolution Enhancement**:
   - DPI increase from 120 to 300-600
   - Smart interpolation for 2x upscaling
   - Maintains quality at larger sizes

6. **Local Adaptive Processing**:
   - LAT (Local Adaptive Thresholding) intelligently separates text from background
   - Handles varying lighting conditions across the page
